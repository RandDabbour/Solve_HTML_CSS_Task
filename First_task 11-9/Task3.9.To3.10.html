        <mark>Sports is a large global business.</mark><br>
<u>Billions of dollars</u> are spent at sporting events, on sports teams, on sports events, as well as on sports-related equipment and apparel. This guide is devoted to those sports that are the largest in terms of monies at the professional level and as a result, not every sport is included. The primary focus is on the professional sports industry in the United States although there are a few instances in which the international aspects of the industry are mentioned. Because of the focus on professional sports, the Olympics and amateur events are not included.
