2)<u>HTML consists of text contained within HTML tags,</u> while<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a> is made up of declaration blocks and selectors Where HTML gives a web browser display information of various tags.
<br>
<u>CSS enhances that information to the browser</u> by adding styling to those <strong>HTMIL</strong> tags.
