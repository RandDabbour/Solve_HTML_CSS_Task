            This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
            <br>
        Jack would really like...
        <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
        You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a>and <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">eToys.</a>
