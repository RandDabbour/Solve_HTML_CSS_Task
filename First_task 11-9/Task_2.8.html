       <mark> Programming is, quite literally, all around us.</mark> From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies<u> — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.</u>

        For many years, only a few people have known how to code. However, that’s starting to change. The number of people learning to code is increasing year by year, with estimates <mark>around 31.1 million software developers worldwide,</mark> which doesn’t even account for the many OTHER careers that relate to programming.

    Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
    Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.

    <b>The problem with programming is not that the computer isn’t logical—the computer is terribly logical, relentlessly literal-minded</b>
